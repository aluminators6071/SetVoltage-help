# SetVoltage-help
So I'm just looking for code that will drive the robot straight, then turn to a certain angle, then drive straight again, turn to another angle.  Something simple as that.

This code that is on here is what my programmer left me.  Feel free to change/delete what is necessary.  I have made a backup copy of this folder.
